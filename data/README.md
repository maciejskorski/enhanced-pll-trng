# Overview

A brief description of the data:

- One folder for each card (CV- Cyclone®V, S6 - Spartan™6, SF - SmartFusion2®)
- The motivation behind configs:
    -  A: same config for all 3 cards
    -  B: high sensitivity and time distances
    -  C: similar to B but with small distances to show the impact of distances
- Scope: files for both 1 and 2 pll outputs
